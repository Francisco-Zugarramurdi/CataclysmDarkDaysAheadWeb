        <h3>CDDA's World is fully filled with lots of deadly creatures ready to face you!</h3>
        <p>Here's a little list</p>
        <h3>Zombies!</h3>
        <p>These are your main, and often your worst enemies after the cataclysm, hungry and angry revived corpses. They
            come in all shapes, sizes and colors! Some zombies can also transform into fungal variants when exposed to
            spores, or other variants when set on fire. Many of the zombies are found in cities, but now and then, they
            can be found in the wilderness.</p>

                <figcaption>A sickly-looking dead one. Its skin looks especially thin, with a sticky, yellow fluid
                    flowing through the clearly visible veins.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>A decaying human body clad in tattered firefighting gear. It staggers aimlessly, reeking of
                    smoke and decay.</figcaption>

        <h3>Netherworld inhabitants</h3>
        <p>
            Cosmic horrors that leak to our world through tears in reality. Also, eldritch.

                <img src="./Assets/migo.png" alt="A mi-go drawing">
                <figcaption>This is an alien creature of uncertain origin. Its shapeless pink body bears numerous sets
                    of paired appendages of unknown function, and a pair of ribbed, membranous wings which seem to be
                    quite useless. Its odd, vaguely pyramid-shaped head bristles with numerous wavering antennae, and
                    simply gazing upon the unnatural beast fills you with primordial dread.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>The Northrup Beagle is a refrigerator-sized urban warfare UGV. Sporting an anti-tank missile
                    launcher, 40mm grenade launcher, and numerous anti-infantry weapons, it's designed for high-risk
                    urban fighting.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>A robot body with the head of a human. All kinds of electronic wires and devices are
                    implanted in its head. Patches of skin look diseased or rotting. This cyborg moves erratically and
                    has a confused and deranged look in its eyes.</figcaption>

                <img src="./Assets/Sentinel.png" alt="A Wraitheon Sentinel drawing">
                <figcaption>
                    Its exterior plates are sable and gold, this luxurious variant of a Wraitheon drone was once kept as
                    a bodyguard by society's wealthiest. Still with its wrist sword extended, it resembles an ancient
                    knight, standing an eternal watch.

                <img src="./Assets/robot.png" alt="A Imaginifier drawing">
                <figcaption>The Imaginifer, one of the few examples of true humaniform robots, was manufactured by
                    Wraitheon for ESCA militaries. They are designed to complement infantry soldiers, being able to use
                    their gear and transports. While similar in shape, they are far removed from the ENIAC's Famulus.
                    The Wraitheon humaniforms are designed to take full advantage of a humanoid shape, not to look
                    human; programmed for game theory, not for sapience.</figcaption>
