        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a turn-based survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world. Struggle to survive
            in
            a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for food,
            equipment, or, if you are lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the hell out of Dodge. Fight
            to
            defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from zombies to giant insects to killer
            robots
            and things far stranger and deadlier, and against the others like yourself, that want what you have…</p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
            As your game begins, you awaken with hazy memories of violence and terror from when the world suddenly
            unravelled around you. Now you need to explore your surroundings, and secure food, water and safety. After
            that, who knows? Long term survival will mean tapping abilities you haven’t used before, learning to survive
            in this new environment, and developing new skills.

        <h2>System Requirements</h2>
        <h3>Minimum</h3>
        <p>“I played catadda 0.B on Lego EV3 brick through ssh about a year ago. Every simple move took a noticeable
            fraction of a second (like 0.3-0.5 second), crafting and such was very slow as well. The specs were - 300
            MhZ CPU, 64 Mb Ram (+ another 64 Mb swap on microsd flash) running ev3dev (stripped ubuntu basically), ssh
            over USB CDC connection.” -burgerpro</p>
        <p>“I used to test the game on an Asus EEE 700. That’s a 900MHz mobile cpu with 500MB of ram.” -Kevin Granade
        </p>
        <p>Tilesets increase the amount of RAM required dramatically. I recommend at least 1GB of ram for tilesets, and
            there are reports of instability due to RAM exhaustion when certain tilesets are used. (The larger the size
            of the individual tiles, the more RAM is used)</p>
        <h3>Recommended</h3>
        <p>“I regularly test the game now on a Windows netbook with a sub 2GHz single core CPU, 1GB of ram, and no
            graphics acceleration.” -Kevin Granade</p>
        <p>Graphical builds run much faster with some kind of graphics acceleration. 2GB of RAM pretty much guarantees
            you will never have trouble with memory shortages.

        <h2>Downloads</h2>
        <p>If you want to download the game you can acces it <a href="downloads.html">here</a></p>
        <p>The most recent stable release is 0.F-2 Frank-2. We recommend stable for the most bug-free experience
            available. You can download it from the Releases Page.</p>
        <h2>Latest Experimental</h2>
        <p>Cataclysm: DDA is under constant development. As such, stable can lag behind with features. If you would like

            latest experimental builds.
